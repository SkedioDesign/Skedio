 * The primary nav, in one place.

 * Work, Services and Blog point at homepage sections rather than their own
 * pages. They were previously declared separately by all seven routes that
 * render a <SiteHeader>, and the copies had drifted: `about.tsx` already used
 * `/#work`-style hashes while `services/` and `projects/` still linked to full
 * pages, so the same nav item meant two different things depending on where
 * you were standing. Declaring them here makes one edit apply everywhere.
 *
 * About stays a full page. The homepage has no studio/team section, so a hash
 * for it would be a jump to nowhere; the bio and the roster only exist on
 * /about. The `/projects` and `/services` pages also stay — reachable from the
 * cards inside each homepage section and from the footer.
 *
 * The `id` of each section and the `hash` here must agree, or the jump lands
 * at the top of the page instead. Every target below sets `scroll-mt-24`, so
 * the sticky header does not cover the heading it scrolls to.
