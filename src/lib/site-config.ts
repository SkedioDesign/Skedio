   * Canonical ORIGIN, used as a concatenation PREFIX — it deliberately carries

   * "https://www.skediodesign.in/about" and not a double slash.
   *
   * It is therefore NOT itself a page URL. The canonical root page URL is
   * "https://www.skediodesign.in/" (WITH the slash), and the one canonical
   * format for the whole site is:
   *
   *   root      -> https://www.skediodesign.in/     (trailing slash)
   *   non-root  -> https://www.skediodesign.in/about  (no trailing slash)
   *
   * Never hand-write a page URL from this field. Use toAbsoluteUrl() in
   * lib/seo.ts, which is the single builder for canonical, og:url, JSON-LD and
   * any other absolute URL, and which applies the root rule above.
   *
   * MUST be the "www" host: the apex https://skediodesign.in 301-redirects to
   * https://www.skediodesign.in/ (vercel.json), so pointing this at the bare
   * apex would make every canonical, og:url, sitemap entry and JSON-LD URL a
   * redirect.
   *
   * No MX record exists for this domain, so siteConfig.email is deliberately a
   * Gmail address rather than hello@skediodesign.in.
