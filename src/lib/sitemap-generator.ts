 * URL convention: NO trailing slash, except the site root which is exactly
 * siteConfig.url + "/". This is enforced by a 308 PERMANENT redirect in
 * src/server.ts (trailingSlashRedirect), which turns "/about/" into "/about"
 * before the router sees it. It must be mirrored here or crawlers see two URL
 * forms per page.
 *
 * Keep every <loc> byte-identical to the page's own <link rel="canonical">,
 * which lib/seo.ts builds the same way.
 *
 * <lastmod> is emitted ONLY where the content model carries a real
 * content-modified date (publishedAt / publishedDate / datePublished). It is
 * deliberately omitted elsewhere rather than filled with today's date: a
 * <lastmod> rewritten on every build is one Google cannot trust, and a
 * sitemap full of them teaches crawlers to ignore the field. <lastmod> is
 * optional per the sitemaps.org spec, so omitting it is valid and strictly
 * more honest than a fabricated date.
 *
 * <changefreq> and <priority> are retained because they are valid per spec,
 * though Google has stated publicly that it ignores both. They are inert.
